Just like an individual stock, the price of an ETF can change from minute to minute throughout any trading day. The price you pay or receive can therefore change based on exactly what time you place your order. This is sometimes referred to as "intraday" pricing.
On the other hand, a mutual fund is priced only at the end of the trading day. Regardless of what time you place your trade, you and everyone else who places a trade on the same day receives the same price, whether you're buying or selling shares.
